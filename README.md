# Wazuh Windows Endpoint Monitoring Lab

This project demonstrates **Windows endpoint security monitoring using Wazuh**, showcasing two common real-world approaches used in SOC environments:

1. **Baseline monitoring using native Windows Event Logs**
2. **Enhanced monitoring using Sysmon integrated with Wazuh**

The goal is to highlight the **difference in visibility, detection capability, and SOC response maturity** between environments that can and cannot deploy Sysmon.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate practical Windows endpoint monitoring with Wazuh
- Compare detection capabilities with and without Sysmon
- Simulate SOC alerting, investigation, and response workflows
- Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Document playbooks for common endpoint threats
